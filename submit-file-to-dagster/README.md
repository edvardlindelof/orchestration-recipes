# Submit file to Dagster
Proof of concept for manually submitting validated files to a Dagster orchestrator.

Check out the [notebook](./notebook.ipynb) to see how it works from the perspective of a submitter using Jupyter.

## Run
Run `uv run dagster dev -f defs.py` in one terminal and `uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab` in another terminal, then open the notebook in a browser.
